NoComelon 

AI storybook generator where parents co-create every story. Your child draws, you direct, AI builds it, and nothing reaches your kid without your approval.

The Problem

Every day, kids watch hours of content made by algorithms optimizing for engagement — not their development. Parents can block it. But they can't replace or curate it.
Until now.

What it does?

NoComelon turns a child's drawing into a 1-2 minute animated storybook with narration, music, and a story arc — all shaped by the parent. The child never interacts with AI directly.
CoComelon feeds your kid content. NoComelon lets you make it.
