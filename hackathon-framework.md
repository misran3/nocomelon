# Building for Impact

Columbia AI for Good Hackathon is not just about building AI. It’s about building AI with purpose.

You will use one of two frameworks to structure your idea:
1. Triple Bottom Line (TBL)
2. Social Business Model Canva

## Triple Bottom Line (TBL)

Every project must answer:

### People

1. Who are you helping?
2. What problem are they facing?
3. How does your solution improve their lives?
4. How will you measure real impact?

**Examples of measurable impact**:
- % reduction in wait time
- Increase in access
- Cost savings for users
- Improved mental health score
- Jobs created

### Planet

1. Does your solution improve environmental outcomes?
2. Does it reduce waste?
3. Optimize energy?
4. Improve resource efficiency?
5. Reduce emissions?

> If not environmental, explain why. Not every project needs a strong planet component, but you must think about it.

### Profit

1. Can this survive in the real world?
2. Who pays?
3. What is your revenue model?
4. Is it sustainable long term?
5. A social idea that cannot sustain itself is not scalable.

### Quick TBL Checklist

Before presenting, ask:
1. Is our social impact measurable?
2. Is the business financially sustainable?
3. Are there trade-offs between impact and profit?
4. Can we scale this beyond Columbia?

## Social Business Model Canvas

This helps you move from idea → real venture.
